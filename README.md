# rock-the-vote

Users can signup and login, allowing them to create "issues" to vote on.

Currently preparing this application for deployment.

## Improvements backlog: 
* Users can vote as many times as they want on an issue -- need to limit to one vote per issue
* Comments section ... ðŸ˜¬ need to design it differently (maybe a modal?)
* The "public" section needs to be rewired so that it doesn't group issues by user (even though this will be useful for task-manager project)
* Need to remove instances of users on the "public" page that have not submitted an issue
